BEST TOOL FOR CONF-MANAGEMENT:
=============================

Ansible is the best configuration management tool and the tool which i like most out of all configuration management tools like chef, puppet and saltstack.

-> It works as a agent less conf management tools (You can only install ansible on Management node, but not require on host node)
-> It works with ssh protocol and interacts with the servers on port number 22
-> It works on Manager and controller architecture
-> A best implemetation to orchestrate the configuration across a bunch of servers in org
-> Python is the pre-requisite to Ansible

IMP BUILD-BLOCKS ANSIBLE:
======================

-> Inventory file is the place where we put all the details of host machines. The default location of the inventory file is (/etc/ansible/hosts)
-> If you are using the custom inventory file you should define the path of inventory in ansible.cfg or pass inventory as command-line argument
